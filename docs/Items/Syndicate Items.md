# Syndicate Items

This is a comprehensive list of all items that traitors and Syndicate Operatives can purchase through their Syndicate uplink hidden on their PDAs. Shortly after round spawn, operatives and traitors will receive notifications telling them a code phrase to input into their PDAs in the ringtone configuration under settings. Both Traitors and Operatives start with 20 Telecrystals (TC) to spend on specialist equipment to complete their objectives. At the moment, both get the same list of choices.
